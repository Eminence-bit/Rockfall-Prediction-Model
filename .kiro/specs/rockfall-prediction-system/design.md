# Design Document

## Overview

The Rockfall Prediction Model is a multi-modal machine learning system that combines computer vision, time-series analysis, and traditional ML techniques to predict rockfall risks in open-pit mines. The model integrates diverse data sources including satellite imagery, geotechnical sensors, environmental data, and digital elevation models to classify risk levels as Low, Medium, or High.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with separate preprocessing pipelines for each data modality, followed by feature fusion and ensemble prediction:
