# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Rockfall Prediction Model is a machine learning solution designed to predict potential rockfall incidents in open-pit mines by analyzing multi-source data inputs including Digital Elevation Models (DEM), drone imagery, geotechnical sensor data, and environmental factors. The model will be trained on available datasets to identify patterns that precede rockfall events and output risk classifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to train a machine learning model using multi-source mining data, so that I can predict rockfall risks with high accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training data is provided THEN the model SHALL accept Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as input features
2. WHEN drone imagery is available THEN the model SHALL process and extract relevant visual features for training
3. WHEN geotechnical sensor data is provided THEN the model SHALL incorporate displacement, strain, and pore pressure measurements
4. WHEN environmental data is available THEN the model SHALL include rainfall, temperature, and vibration data as features
5. WHEN training is complete THEN the model SHALL achieve minimum 85% accuracy on validation data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to preprocess and integrate multiple dataset formats, so that the model can learn from diverse data sources effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN remote sensing images with JSON annotations are provided THEN the model SHALL extract and process object detection features
2. WHEN satellite imagery with YOLO annotations is available THEN the model SHALL incorporate mine boundary segmentation data
3. WHEN structured CSV data is provided THEN the model SHALL handle tabular features with proper encoding
4. WHEN seismic data files are available THEN the model SHALL process time-series signals for rockfall detection patterns
5. IF data sources have different formats THEN the model SHALL normalize and align features for consistent processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the model to classify rockfall risk levels, so that I can provide actionable predictions for mine safety management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input features are processed THEN the model SHALL output risk classifications as Low, Medium, or High
2. WHEN predictions are made THEN the model SHALL provide confidence scores for each risk classification
3. WHEN multiple data points are available THEN the model SHALL aggregate information to improve prediction reliability
4. WHEN insufficient data is present THEN the model SHALL indicate uncertainty in predictions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a model developer, I want to evaluate model performance using standard metrics, so that I can validate the model's effectiveness for rockfall prediction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model evaluation is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each risk class
2. WHEN cross-validation is applied THEN the model SHALL demonstrate consistent performance across different data splits
3. WHEN confusion matrix is generated THEN the model SHALL show clear separation between risk classes
4. WHEN ROC curves are plotted THEN the model SHALL achieve AUC scores above 0.8 for binary classifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the model to handle real-world data challenges, so that it can work effectively with imperfect mining datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN missing data is encountered THEN the model SHALL use appropriate imputation strategies
2. WHEN outliers are present THEN the model SHALL apply robust preprocessing techniques
3. WHEN class imbalance exists THEN the model SHALL use techniques like SMOTE or class weighting
4. WHEN new data arrives THEN the model SHALL support incremental learning or retraining workflows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a model user, I want to save and load the trained model, so that I can deploy it for making predictions on new data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is complete THEN the model SHALL be serializable to standard formats (pickle, joblib, or ONNX)
2. WHEN the model is loaded THEN it SHALL maintain identical prediction behavior as the original trained model
3. WHEN model metadata is needed THEN the system SHALL save feature names, preprocessing parameters, and model version
4. WHEN predictions are made THEN the loaded model SHALL process new input data with the same preprocessing pipeline
